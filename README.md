# Stacks and queues in c
This repo contains stack and queue tasks which are executed using the monty language

## The Monty Language
Monty 0.98 is a scripting language that is first compiled into Monty byte codes (Just like Python). It relies on a unique stack, with specific instructions to manipulate it. The goal of this project is to create an interpreter for Monty ByteCodes files.
Files containing Monty byte codes usually have the .m extension and are contained in the [bytecodes](https://github.com/devmutinda/monty/tree/main/bytecodes) directory of this repo.
